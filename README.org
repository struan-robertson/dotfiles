#+title: My Dotfiles

Requires [[https://github.com/jirutka/esh][esh]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/][make]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][stow]].

- Install all with ~make all~
- Uninstall all with ~make delete~
- Install specific folder (i.e. =emacs=) with ~make stow-emacs~
- Uninstall specific folder with ~make delete-emacs~

=esh= first parses =.esh= template files, then =stow= symlinks files and folders to =$HOME=.

System dirs which should be created rather than symlinked are handled in the =system_dirs= command in the makefile.
